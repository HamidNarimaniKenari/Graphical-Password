                        Now-a-days an important usability goal for authentication systems is to support
                        users in selecting better passwords. Users often create memorable passwords that
                        are easy for attackers to guess, but strong system assigned passwords are difficult
                        for users to remember. So researchers of modern days have gone for alternative methods
                        wherein graphical pictures are used as passwords. Graphical passwords essentially
                        use images or representation of images as passwords. Human brain is good in remembering
                        picture than textual character.
